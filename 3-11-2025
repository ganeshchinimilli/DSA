Time and Space Complexity

Time Complexity (need to get the relationship between input and time).
    we want to evaluate teh algorithm,evaluate teh scalability,interms of the input size



1.Measuring the Time To Execute--won't used in the industry
    using the import time --time.time() and the end time.time() can do the time measuring.
    while was faster than the for loop in python
    No relation will come to establsh the relation between input and the time
    Based on the system operations everything will change.
    differnt time for different algorithm
2.Counting the Operations involved
    The no of operations executed as funciton of size of input.
    Different machines same time.
    differnt time for different algorithm.
    Can establish a relation between teh time and the input.
3.Abstract notation of order of Growth
    Big O Notation measures the upper bound on the asymptotic growth,often called order of Growth.
    Big Oh or O() used to describe the worst case.(bottleneck of the program).
        Express rate of growth of the programm w.r.to input size
        evaluate algorithmic not machine or implementation.
    
    def fact(n):
        answer =1 -- 1 opertion
        while n>1:-- 1 opertion
            answer*=n -- 2 opertion
            n-=1 -- 2 opertion
        return answer
    
    the Above expression would be 1+5n
    Remove the additive constants,multiplative constants,largest factors then we will get the big oh notation from the operation expression
    0(n) ---means linear  .so the graph means input and time will be linear.
    n@2+2n+2 -- O(n@2) - quadratic relation with input and time.
    n@2+100000n+ 3@10000 -- O(n@2)
    log(n)+n+4 -- O(n)
    1000nLog(n)+n -- O(log(n))
Types of Order or growth are 
x-input ,y --time
Constant(for every input the time will be constant)--parallel to x axis
liner(for same input same time increment)--45degree line
quadratic(parabolic lin)
lograthmic (reverse parabolic)
nlogN(bottom x and sam eas parabolic)
expoential(some what parabolic)
